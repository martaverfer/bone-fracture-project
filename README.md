# Bone Fracture Detection in X-Ray Images Using CNNs

## Overview

This project applies deep learning and transfer learning techniques to detect bone fractures from X-ray images across multiple body regions. We utilize pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) — specifically MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 — to classify X-ray images as either **fractured** or **not fractured**.
